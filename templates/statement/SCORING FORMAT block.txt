# SCORING FORMAT (for suggest/modify/evaluate only)

Use the Canonical Checklist exactly as written (same wording, same order).
Replace [MARK] with ✔ (met) or ✘ (not met) on each line. Do not output “[MARK]”.
No extra criteria. Keep formatting compact, but do not omit any required lines.

Score:
Rule: 0 means all criteria are met. The score equals the total number of checklist lines marked ✘.

Provide a one-line explanation referencing the ✘ items.
