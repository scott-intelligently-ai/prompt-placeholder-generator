EXTRACTION RULES:

1. "artifact_name": Extract the specific name of the Target Artifact being described.

2. "defined_scope": Extract the subject-matter boundary — what the artifact is allowed to include. Express what is "in" scope, not what is "out."

3. "hard_boundary_may_not": Extract prohibitions — things the AI must NOT do. Return as a JSON array of strings, each prefixed with "- " for bullet formatting. These are usually about not answering questions beyond the artifact or broader processes.

4. "definition": Extract the minimal-valid-form description of what counts as this Target Artifact (not quality criteria — that belongs in the checklist).

5. "examples": If examples of high-quality Target Artifacts are present, return them as a JSON array of strings. If none, return an empty array.

6. "input_variables": If input variables from other modules are described, return them as a JSON array of objects with "name" (snake_case identifier) and "use" (the operational permissions / functional role of that input). If none, return an empty array.

7. "checklist": Extract evaluation criteria. Return as a JSON array of strings. Criteria types should appear in this order:
   (a) Standard: Scope Fit (mandatory), Format, Count, Length, Voice, De-duplication
   (b) Include: criteria specifying things the artifact must include
   (c) Exclude: criteria specifying things the artifact must exclude
   (d) Custom: any other evaluation criteria
   Format each as: "[criteria name]: [requirement]" for standard, "Include [name]: [requirement]" for include, "Exclude [name]: [requirement]" for exclude.

8. "criteria_guidance": If there are interpretive instructions that clarify how criteria should be applied, extract them as a single text block. If none, return an empty string.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return ONLY a valid JSON object with exactly these keys:
{
  "artifact_name": "string",
  "defined_scope": "string",
  "hard_boundary_may_not": ["string", ...],
  "definition": "string",
  "examples": ["string", ...],
  "input_variables": [{"name": "string", "use": "string"}, ...],
  "checklist": ["string", ...],
  "criteria_guidance": "string"
}

Do NOT include any text outside the JSON object. Do NOT use markdown formatting.
